title: 'Ensure the Root Bash Umask is Set Correctly'

description: |-
    To ensure the root user's umask of the Bash shell is set properly,
    add or correct the <tt>umask</tt> setting in <tt>/root/.bashrc</tt>
    or <tt>/root/.profile</tt> to read as follows:
    <pre>umask 0027</pre>

rationale: |-
    The umask value influences the permissions assigned to files when they are created.
    A misconfigured umask value could result in files with excessive permissions that can be read or
    written to by unauthorized users.
